markdown
Copy
Edit

7. Save the settings.

### Using Your Credentials

Add the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to your `.env.local` file in the project root:


### Testing Spotify API with Postman
You can manually test Spotify API endpoints (like /me/tracks) using Postman:

## 1. Open Postman & Create New Request
Click the + tab to create a new request.

In the URL bar, enter:


https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/tracks  or https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/playlists
## 2. Go to the Authorization Tab
Click the Authorization tab below the URL bar.

Set Type to OAuth 2.0.

## 3. Get New Access Token
Click Get New Access Token.

Fill out the popup form with your Spotify app credentials and settings:

| Field               | Value                                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Token Name          | Any name (e.g. SpotifyToken)                                                      |
| Grant Type          | Authorization Code                                                                |
| Callback URL        | Same as your Spotify app redirect URI (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/callback`)     |
| Auth URL            | `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize`                                          |
| Access Token URL    | `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`                                          |
| Client ID           | Your Spotify Client ID                                                            |
| Client Secret       | Your Spotify Client Secret                                                        |
| Scope               | `user-library-read user-library-modify`                                           |
| State / Client Auth | Leave state empty; choose **Send as Basic Auth header** for client authentication |


## 4. Click Get Token
A browser window will open for Spotify login and authorization.

After approval, Postman receives the access token.

## 5. Click Use Token
This attaches the token automatically as a Bearer token in the headers.

## 6. Click Send
Send the request to test the /me/tracks endpoint.

### Important Notes
Make sure your Spotify app's Redirect URI matches the Callback URL used in Postman.

Use a Spotify account that has saved tracks for meaningful data.

Example Access Token Response from Your App
You can get a valid access token from your appâ€™s session API:


GET https://spotify-homepage-clone-two.vercel.app/api/auth/session
Example JSON response:


{
  "user": {
    "name": "example",
    "email": "example@gmail.com"
  },
  "expires": "2025-06-28T04:00:25.525Z",
  "accessToken": "BQBht0j0vFtAOXREDtN93PQIAOZSq19K3OJlSJoVPs54IRVInMwID1IjpXEeebjFbP8gsdZL2GiPDsmdGvI12xlFodyAfjJP6kJcz3jAWIxVf_1PQOUVSPOHN2JTJ2MZTUOH4NTRHGoiQyvwgKMbDnSjdRvY6d-yFifZPRMDgxlZF2_aEKukfhzOsCM-FWPFPxbLSZrqAaeJI3y-H6Ft4I0ryoJBqVN91F6G5i5xnqVtyt4mtQvNhnQCAsNevzyN"
}
You can use this accessToken as a Bearer token in Postman to test Spotify endpoints without going through OAuth flow each time.
